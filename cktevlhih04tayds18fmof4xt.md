## Introduction 
CSS as a style sheet language can be a little hard to master or even know how all of its properties even actually work. But taking it one step at a time could help you understand it better. 

## So what is Display property?

Display property determines how the elements are treated or the behavior of the elements. It sets an element's inner and outer display types. From the elements flow direction to how much space will the element occupy. Everything is determined by the values of the Display property.   

## Different values of Display property?

### Block 
It displays an element as a block element. It means that it takes up the entire width given to it. generating line breaks both before and after the element. Thus taking up an entire block.

### Inline
It displays an element as an inline element. It means that it takes up the minimum amount of space necessary to fit all the contents inside of it.

### Inline-block
They have similar to the `inline` property but also have the properties of `block`, But with `Inline-block` you can give it a specific height and width.  With `Display: inline`, you cannot specify the height and width of the elements. So for inline elements to have a width and height property you need to use `inline -block`.

Now, these are is still `Display: flex` and `Display: Gird` but too complex thus deserve an article of their own. To break them down into smaller pieces for you to understand them and their properties better.
